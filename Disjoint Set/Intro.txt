Suppose there we need to know if two people are friends.
There are also other problems like island problems

There are mainly two things we need to do
    1. makefriends(To generate a connection)
    2. areFriends(To check if two people are friends or not)

In problems like these we can use graphs:
    Use: Adjacency List or Adjacency Matrix
    Representation,
    Adjacency List: makefriends(), areFriends() is O(n)
    Adjacency Matrix: makefriends() is O(n) and areFriends() is O(1)

The Disjoint Set is a Data Structure that can be used to solve these kind of Data Structures effectively:

There are mainly two operations in this Data Structure
1. Find(x): Returns a representative of x's set (or social network)
2. Union(x,y): Combines sets of x and y (same as makefriends())

makefriends(){
    Union(x,y)
}

areFriends(){
    Find(x) == Find(y)
}
